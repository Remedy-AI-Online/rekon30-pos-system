# Business Signup Flow - Super Admin Approval System

## Overview
Updated the business signup process to require Super Admin approval before account activation. All new business registrations are now sent to the Super Admin for review and activation.

---

## What Changed

### **1. Frontend Changes**

#### **`BusinessSetup.tsx`**
- âœ… Updated completion message from "Ready for Activation" to "Pending Activation"
- âœ… Changed message to: "Your business registration has been submitted successfully. Please contact the Super Admin to activate your account."
- âœ… Color scheme changed from green (success) to blue (pending)

#### **`AuthPage.tsx`**
- âœ… Modified `handleAdminSignup` to submit signup request instead of creating account directly
- âœ… No longer calls `authService.signUp()`
- âœ… Now calls new Edge Function: `business-signup-requests`
- âœ… Updated button text from "Create Admin Account" to "Submit Registration"
- âœ… Shows toast: "Registration submitted! Please contact Super Admin for activation."
- âœ… Returns user to login page after successful submission
- âœ… **Login functions remain unchanged** (admin, cashier, super admin login all work as before)

### **2. Backend Changes**

#### **New Edge Function: `business-signup-requests/index.ts`**
Created a new Edge Function to handle signup requests with multiple actions:

**Actions:**
1. **Default (Create Request)**
   - Accepts: `email`, `password`, `businessConfig`
   - Validates: Checks for duplicate pending requests
   - Creates: New record in `business_signup_requests` table
   - Returns: Success confirmation

2. **`?action=get-all`**
   - Fetches all signup requests for Super Admin
   - Ordered by creation date (newest first)
   - Returns: Array of pending/approved/rejected requests

3. **`?action=approve`**
   - Accepts: `requestId`, `plan`, `features`
   - Creates: Business in `businesses` table
   - Creates: Auth user with admin role
   - Updates: Request status to 'approved'
   - Returns: Created business and user data

4. **`?action=reject`**
   - Accepts: `requestId`, `reason`
   - Updates: Request status to 'rejected'
   - Stores: Rejection reason
   - Returns: Success confirmation

#### **New Migration: `007_business_signup_requests.sql`**
Created table to store signup requests:

**Table: `business_signup_requests`**
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- email (TEXT)
- password (TEXT) -- Temporarily stored for account creation
- business_name (TEXT)
- business_type (TEXT)
- business_size (TEXT)
- location_count (INTEGER)
- description (TEXT)
- selected_features (JSONB)
- payment_method (TEXT)
- phone (TEXT)
- address (TEXT)
- status (TEXT) -- 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
- approved_at (TIMESTAMP)
- rejected_at (TIMESTAMP)
- rejection_reason (TEXT)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_signup_requests_status` (for filtering by status)
- `idx_signup_requests_email` (for duplicate checks)
- `idx_signup_requests_created_at` (for sorting)

**Security:**
- RLS enabled
- Only service_role can access (Super Admin backend)

## Next Steps (To Implement)

### **1. Super Admin Dashboard - Pending Requests Tab**
Add a new section in Super Admin Panel to view and manage signup requests:

**UI Components:**
- Table/list of pending requests
- View detailed business info
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Status badges (pending/approved/rejected)
- Search and filter options

**Features:**
- Real-time updates when new request arrives
- Notification system for new requests
- Bulk approval/rejection
- Email templates for approval/rejection notifications

### **2. Update `SuperAdminBusinesses` Component**
Add "Pending Signups" tab alongside existing businesses:
```typescript
<Tabs>
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger>Active Businesses</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger>Pending Signups</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent>...</TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### **3. Notification System**
- Send email to user when approved
- Send email to user if rejected (with reason)
- Notify Super Admin of new signup requests

### **4. Auto-cleanup**
- Delete old rejected requests after 30 days
- Delete approved requests after business is created

---

## Security Considerations

### âœ… Implemented
- RLS on signup_requests table
- Only service_role can access
- Duplicate email check
- Password stored temporarily (encrypted in transit)

### ðŸ”„ Recommended (Future)
- Hash passwords in signup_requests table
- Add rate limiting on signup endpoint
- Add CAPTCHA to signup form
- Implement email verification
- Add request expiration (auto-reject after 30 days)
