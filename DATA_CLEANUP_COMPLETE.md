- ✅ After: 0 KV entries
- ✅ **Result: All KV store data cleared!**

### 3. **Auth Users**
Removed cashier and worker login accounts:
- ✅ Deleted all `auth.users` with role 'cashier' or 'worker'

---

## 🎯 What Data Remains (Preserved)

### ✅ System Data (NOT Deleted)
1. **Super Admin Account** - Still active and functional
2. **Admin Account** (dapaahsylvester5@gmail.com) - Still active
3. **Businesses Table** - Your business record remains
4. **Business Signup Requests** - Signup history preserved
5. **System Tables** - RLS policies, functions, schema intact

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. **Clear Browser Cache**
Your browser may still have cached data in localStorage.

**Option A: Use the HTML Tool** (Easiest)
```bash
# Open the file in your browser:
clear-browser-cache.html

# Then click "Clear Browser Cache" button
```

**Option B: Manual Browser Clear**
1. Open your Rekon30 app
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Run this command:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('rekon360-offline-data')
console.log('Cache cleared!')
```
5. Press `Ctrl+F5` to hard refresh

### 2. **Verify Clean State**
After clearing browser cache, refresh your app and check:
- ✅ Dashboard should show 0 transactions, 0 revenue
- ✅ Products page should be empty
- ✅ Customers page should be empty
- ✅ Workers page should be empty
- ✅ Sales page should be empty

### 3. **Start Fresh**
Your admin account (dapaahsylvester5@gmail.com) is ready to:
- Add new products
- Add new customers
- Add new workers
- Make new sales

All data will be truly yours - no mock data!

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Multi-Tenancy Issue Identified**
   - Current tables (`products`, `customers`, `workers`, `sales`) **do not have `business_id` column**
   - This means data is **not isolated per business** yet
   - For production, these tables should be updated to include `business_id` for proper multi-tenancy

2. **Data Storage Architecture**
   - Main data is stored in **KV Store** (kv_store_86b98184 table)
   - PostgreSQL tables exist but are **not currently used** by the app
   - Offline sync uses **localStorage** for web, **Electron storage** for desktop

3. **Mock Data Sources**
   - Previously, mock data was in the KV store (now cleared ✅)
   - Browser localStorage may still cache old data (clear it!)
