# Credit Sales Page - Now Fixed! ‚úÖ

## Issue:
Clicking "Credit Sales (Book)" in sidebar showed Dashboard instead of Credit Management page

## Root Cause:
CreditManagementPage.tsx used wrong import paths:
- ‚ùå Used: `@/components/ui/card` (alias path - not configured in this project)
- ‚úÖ Should be: `./ui/card` (relative path)

## Fix Applied:
Updated all 10 imports in CreditManagementPage.tsx to use relative paths:
- `@/components/ui/*` ‚Üí `./ui/*`
- `@/utils/*` ‚Üí `../utils/*`

## Test Now:
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Click "Credit Sales (Book)" in sidebar
3. Should now show Credit Management page! ‚úÖ

Tell Supabase AI to create the 3 tables from setup-credit-sales-system.html
```

1. Go to "Credit Sales (Book)" page
2. Click "Add Credit Customer"

   - Name: Auntie Ama

4. Click "Create Customer"

### 3. View Customer:
- Customer appears in table
- Shows: GHS 0.00 balance (no sales yet)
- Click "View Details" to see history

## Next: Make a Credit Sale

**From Cashier POS** (coming soon):
1. Add items to cart
2. Click "Credit Sale (Book)"
3. Select customer
