---

## **Feature Mapping Logic**

### **How Features Are Enabled**

1. **Super Admin** enables/disables features for each business in the Features tab
2. **Admin Dashboard** shows menu items based on the business's enabled features
3. **Cashier Dashboard** shows core features only (no advanced features)

### **Feature ID Consistency**

All feature IDs are now consistent across the system:
- âœ… `inventory` - Used everywhere
- âœ… `sales` - Used everywhere
- âœ… `customers` - Used everywhere (replaced `customer-loyalty`)
- âœ… `reports` - Used everywhere
- âœ… `workers` - Used for advanced features (combined workers + payroll)
- âœ… `multi-location` - Used for location management
- âœ… `analytics` - Used for advanced analytics

---

## **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Super Admin Features (`SuperAdminFeatures.tsx`)**
- âœ… Changed core feature from `workers` to `customers`
- âœ… Renamed `customer-loyalty` to removed it
- âœ… Combined `payroll` into `workers` as "Workers & Payroll"
- âœ… Updated `CORE_FEATURES` array to: `['inventory', 'sales', 'customers', 'reports']`

### **2. Admin Sidebar (`Sidebar.tsx`)**
- âœ… Renamed "Products" to "Inventory" (mapped to `inventory` feature)
- âœ… Renamed "Orders" to "Sales" (mapped to `sales` feature)
- âœ… Made "Customers" always visible (core feature)
- âœ… Combined "Workers" and "Payroll" into single "Workers & Payroll" menu item
- âœ… Removed redundant feature checks
- âœ… Simplified conditional logic

### **3. Cashier Sidebar (`CashierSidebar.tsx`)**
- âœ… Removed "Sales History" as separate addon (merged into core)
- âœ… Made all menu items core features (POS, Inventory, Customers, Reports)
- âœ… Simplified logic - no more addon checks
- âœ… Consistent with 4 core features

## **Benefits of This Alignment**

1. **Consistency** - Same feature IDs used across all systems
2. **Simplicity** - Clear mapping between Super Admin features and dashboard menus
3. **Maintainability** - Easy to add new features in one place
4. **Scalability** - Core features are protected, advanced features can be toggled
5. **User Experience** - Clear feature hierarchy (Core â†’ Advanced â†’ Enterprise)

## **How to Add New Features**

### **Step 1: Add to Super Admin Feature Catalog**
```typescript
// In SuperAdminFeatures.tsx
advanced: [
  { id: 'new-feature', name: 'New Feature', icon: IconName, description: 'Description here' }
]
```

### **Step 2: Add to Admin Sidebar (if needed)**
```typescript
// In Sidebar.tsx
{ id: "new-feature", label: "New Feature", icon: IconName, show: false, addon: true }
```

### **Step 3: Add Feature Check Logic**
```typescript
// In Sidebar.tsx getMenuItems()
if (item.id === 'new-feature') {
  shouldShow = selectedFeatures?.includes('new-feature') || false
}
```

### **Step 4: Create the Feature Component**
Create the actual UI component for the feature and add it to the main routing/rendering logic.
