## 🎯 Impact on Business Accounts

### **Existing Businesses:**
All businesses currently have these **core features enabled by default**:
- ✅ Inventory Management
- ✅ Sales & POS
- ✅ **Worker Management** (now core)
- ✅ Reports & Analytics

### **New Business Signups:**
Going forward, all new businesses will receive:
- ✅ Inventory, Sales, Workers, Reports (basic plan)
- 💰 Customers, Multi-Location, Analytics (requires upgrade)

### **Your Business (Foam Shop Manager):**
Since you're on the **basic plan**, your sidebar now shows:
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Inventory
- ✅ Sales
- ✅ **Workers** (visible by default)
- ✅ Reports
- ✅ Settings
- ❌ Customers (hidden - requires Super Admin to enable it as an add-on)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **For Your Business:**
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + F5)
2. Login to your admin dashboard
3. Verify **Workers** appears in the sidebar
4. Verify **Customers** is now hidden (unless Super Admin enables it)

### **To Access Customers Page:**
If you need the Customers feature:
1. Ask Super Admin to enable it
2. Or, implement plan upgrades and upgrade to Pro

---

## 📝 Business Logic

### **Why This Change Makes Sense:**
- **Workers** are essential for any business to manage employees
- **Customers** are more advanced - not all businesses track customer data
- Foam shops typically need to manage workers (stock handlers, sales staff)
- Customer tracking is optional - many businesses just do walk-in sales

### **Code Protection:**
- ✅ Core features (`workers`) **cannot be disabled** by Super Admin
- ✅ Add-on features (`customers`) can be enabled/disabled
- ✅ All changes are logged in `business_feature_log` table

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Updated `Sidebar.tsx` - Workers is core, Customers is add-on
- [x] Updated `SuperAdminFeatures.tsx` - Feature catalog updated
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Feature swap documented

**Status: COMPLETE** 🎉
