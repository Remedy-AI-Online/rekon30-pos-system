# Fixes Applied - Rekon360

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Workers Not Showing in Payroll** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Workers created but not appearing in payroll page, even after refresh

**Root Cause:** PayrollPage was using `publicAnonKey` instead of user's auth token, so couldn't filter by business_id

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `PayrollPage.tsx` to use `getSupabaseClient()` and `session.access_token`
- All functions now properly use auth tokens:
  - `loadWorkers()` - Now filters by business_id
  - `loadPayroll()` - Now filters by business_id
  - `savePayrollRecord()` - Now includes business_id
  - `handleProcessPayroll()` - Now uses auth token
  - `handleMarkAsPaid()` - Now uses auth token

**How to Test:**
1. Go to Workers page
2. Create a worker (e.g., "John Doe")
3. Go to Payroll page
4. Click "Generate This Month's Payroll"
5. Worker should now appear! ✅

### 2. **Sidebar Features Not Showing** ⚠️ REQUIRES LOGOUT

**Problem:** Added features to admin account but sidebar doesn't show new features

**Root Cause:** User's session has old `user_metadata`. When you add features in database/Super Admin, the logged-in user's session doesn't auto-update.

**Solution (Choose One):**

**Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
1. Log out
2. Log back in
3. Features will now show! ✅

**Option B: Wait 30 Seconds**
- The sidebar now checks for updates every 30 seconds
- Wait a bit and refresh the page
- Features should appear

**Technical Details:**
- Features are stored in `user.user_metadata.features`
- When Super Admin updates features, it updates the auth database
- But logged-in sessions don't automatically refresh
- Logging out and back in gets fresh user_metadata

**How Features Work:**
- **Core Features** (Always visible to admin): Dashboard, Inventory, Sales, Workers, Payroll, Reports, Settings, Credit Sales
- **Addon Features** (Require feature flag): Customer Management, Analytics, Locations, API Access, White Label, Priority Support, Custom Features

### 3. **SMS Message Visibility** ℹ️ INFO

**Status:** SMS functionality is working! The "SMS Receipt" button appears after a sale.

**How to Find It:**
1. Login as Cashier
2. Make a sale in POS
3. After sale completes, you'll see an alert box
4. Click "SMS Receipt" button in that alert
5. Enter customer phone number
6. SMS will be sent via Arkesel! 📱

**Important:**
- Make sure you set up Arkesel (run `setup-arkesel.bat` or see `setup-arkesel-sms.html`)
- Sender ID must be "Rekon360" (or your approved sender ID)
- Cost: ~4 pesewas per SMS
