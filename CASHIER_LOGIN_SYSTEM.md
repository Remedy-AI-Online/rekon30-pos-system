# 🔐 Cashier Login System - Complete Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Problem:**
- Cashier logins were not properly linked to business admins
- No `business_id` association for multi-tenancy
- Cashiers couldn't be filtered by business
- Password resets didn't update Supabase Auth

### **Solution:**
- ✅ Added `business_id` to cashier creation
- ✅ Auto-detect business from logged-in admin
- ✅ Store cashiers by business for easy lookup
- ✅ Update Supabase Auth when resetting passwords
- ✅ Added endpoint to get cashiers by business ID

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Cashier Data Storage:**

```
1. Supabase Auth (auth.users)
   └─ email: csh123456@foamshopmanager.local
   └─ user_metadata:
      ├─ role: 'cashier'
      ├─ name: 'Worker Name'
      ├─ cashierId: 'CSH123456'
      ├─ business_id: 'uuid-of-business'
      ├─ shopId: 'uuid-of-business'
      └─ shopName: 'Foam Shop Manager'

2. KV Store (kv_store_86b98184)
   └─ cashier_CSH123456:
      ├─ id: 'CSH123456'
      ├─ workerId: 'worker-uuid'
      ├─ workerName: 'Worker Name'
      ├─ businessId: 'business-uuid'
      ├─ shopId: 'business-uuid'
      ├─ shopName: 'Foam Shop Manager'
      ├─ email: 'csh123456@foamshopmanager.local'
      ├─ password: 'abc12345' (for admin view)
      ├─ authUserId: 'auth-user-uuid'
      ├─ active: true
      ├─ createdAt: '2025-01-15T...'
      ├─ lastLogin: null
      └─ loginCount: 0

3. Business Lookup (kv_store_86b98184)
   └─ business_{businessId}_cashiers:
      └─ ['CSH123456', 'CSH789012', ...]
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### **1. Creating a Cashier Login**

When an admin creates a cashier from the Workers page:

```typescript
// Frontend calls:
POST /make-server-86b98184/auth/create-cashier

// Request body:
{
  workerId: "worker-uuid",
  workerName: "John Doe",
  shopId: "optional",
  shopName: "optional",
  businessId: "optional" // Auto-detected if not provided
}

// Backend:
1. Extract admin's business_id from auth token
2. Get business details from 'businesses' table
3. Generate unique cashier ID (CSH123456)
4. Generate random password (8 chars)
5. Create email: csh123456@businessname.local
6. Create Supabase Auth user with:
   - role: 'cashier'
   - business_id: business-uuid
   - cashierId, shopId, shopName
7. Store cashier data in KV store
8. Link cashier to business
9. Update worker record
10. Return credentials to admin
```

### **2. Cashier Login Process**

```typescript
// Cashier enters:
- Cashier ID: CSH123456
- Shop ID: Foam Shop Manager (or business-uuid)
- Password: abc12345

// Frontend:
1. Constructs email: csh123456@foamshopmanager.local
2. Calls Supabase Auth signInWithPassword()
3. Gets user with metadata (includes business_id)
4. Updates lastLogin and loginCount in KV store
5. Redirects to Cashier Dashboard
```

### **3. Admin Viewing Cashiers**

```typescript
// Frontend calls:
GET /make-server-86b98184/businesses/{businessId}/cashiers

// Response:
{
  success: true,
  cashiers: [
    {
      id: "CSH123456",
      workerName: "John Doe",
      email: "csh123456@foamshopmanager.local",
      password: "abc12345", // Visible to admin only
      active: true,
      lastLogin: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      loginCount: 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### **4. Password Reset**

```typescript
// Admin resets cashier password:
POST /make-server-86b98184/cashiers/{cashierId}/reset-password

// Backend:
1. Generate new random password
2. Update Supabase Auth password
3. Update KV store password
4. Return new password to admin
```

## 📊 Multi-Tenancy Implementation

### **Business Isolation:**

Each business admin only sees their own cashiers:

```sql
-- Business A (Foam Shop Manager)
Cashiers:
  - CSH123456 (John Doe)
  - CSH789012 (Jane Smith)

-- Business B (Mattress Store)
Cashiers:
  - CSH111222 (Bob Wilson)
  - CSH333444 (Alice Brown)
```

### **Data Filtering:**

```typescript
// OLD (No isolation):
GET /cashiers → Returns ALL cashiers from all businesses ❌

// NEW (Proper isolation):
GET /businesses/{businessId}/cashiers → Returns only this business's cashiers ✅
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### **1. Auto-Confirmed Emails**
- Cashier emails are auto-confirmed (no verification needed)
- Email format: `csh{id}@{businessname}.local`

### **2. Business Linking**
- Every cashier has a `business_id` in their metadata
- Prevents cross-business access

### **3. Password Management**
- Passwords stored in KV for admin view (plain text)
- Passwords hashed in Supabase Auth (secure)
- Password resets update both systems

### **4. Active Status**
- Cashiers can be activated/deactivated
- Inactive cashiers can't login

## 🎯 Usage Example

### **Admin Creates Cashier:**

1. Admin logs in to **Workers & Payroll** page
2. Adds a new worker (e.g., "John Doe")
3. Clicks "Create Login" next to John Doe
4. System generates:
   ```
   Cashier ID: CSH123456
   Email: csh123456@foamshopmanager.local
   Password: abc12345
   ```
5. Admin shares credentials with John Doe

### **Cashier Logs In:**

1. Cashier goes to login page
2. Selects "Cashier Login"
3. Enters:
   - Cashier ID: `CSH123456`
   - Shop: `Foam Shop Manager`
   - Password: `abc12345`
4. System logs them into Cashier Dashboard

### **Admin Manages Cashiers:**

1. Admin views "Workers & Payroll" → "Cashiers" tab
2. Sees all cashiers for their business
3. Can:
   - View login credentials
   - Reset passwords
   - Activate/Deactivate logins
   - See last login time
