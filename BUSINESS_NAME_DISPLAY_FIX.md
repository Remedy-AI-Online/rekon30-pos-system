# 🏢 Dynamic Business Name Display - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Every business that signs up sees "Foam Shop Manager" at the top instead of their actual business name.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Edge Function Update** (`business-signup-requests/index.ts`)
- When approving a business, now fetches the `business_name` from the `businesses` table
- Adds `business_name` to the admin user's `user_metadata`
- This ensures the business name is available immediately after login

```typescript
// Fetch the business name from the businesses table
const { data: business } = await supabaseClient
  .from('businesses')
  .select('business_name')
  .eq('id', result.business_id)
  .single()

const businessName = business?.business_name || 'Business'

// Add to user metadata
user_metadata: {
  role: 'admin',
  business_id: result.business_id,
  business_name: businessName,  // ✅ NEW
  name: result.owner_name || 'Admin',
  plan: result.plan || 'basic',
  features: result.features || []
}
```

#### 2. **Auth Service Update** (`src/utils/authService.ts`)
- Now caches the `businessName` in localStorage along with other features
- Available offline for 24 hours

```typescript
localStorage.setItem('rekon360-features', JSON.stringify({
  plan,
  features,
  businessId,
  businessName,  // ✅ NEW
  lastSync: new Date().toISOString(),
  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24*60*60*1000).toISOString()
}))
```

#### 3. **Sidebar Component Update** (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Added `getBusinessName()` function that checks multiple sources:
  1. User metadata (`user.user_metadata.business_name`)
  2. Cached features in localStorage
  3. Business config prop
  4. Fallback to "Business"
- Now displays the actual business name dynamically

```typescript
const getBusinessName = () => {
  // First try user metadata
  if (user?.user_metadata?.business_name) {
    return user.user_metadata.business_name
  }
  
  // Try cached features
  const cachedFeatures = localStorage.getItem('rekon360-features')
  if (cachedFeatures) {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(cachedFeatures)
    if (parsed.businessName) {
      return parsed.businessName
    }
  }
  
  // Try businessConfig
  if (businessConfig?.businessName) {
    return businessConfig.businessName
  }
  
  // Fallback
  return 'Business'
}

const businessName = getBusinessName()

// Display in UI
<h1 className="font-semibold text-foreground">{businessName}</h1>
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **For New Businesses:**
1. User signs up with business name (e.g., "LatexFoam Ghana")
2. Super Admin approves the business
3. Edge Function creates admin user with `business_name` in metadata
4. When admin logs in, they see **"LatexFoam Ghana"** at the top
5. Business name is cached for offline use

### **For Existing Businesses:**
1. They will see "Business" until they log out and log back in
2. On next login, the new metadata will be loaded
3. Or Super Admin can manually update their user metadata

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Data Flow:**
1. Business signup → `businesses` table gets `business_name`
2. Admin creation → `user_metadata.business_name` gets set
3. Login → Auth service caches `businessName` in localStorage
4. Sidebar → Reads from metadata → Displays business name

### **Fallback Chain:**
```
user.user_metadata.business_name
  ↓ (if not found)
localStorage['rekon360-features'].businessName
  ↓ (if not found)
businessConfig.businessName
  ↓ (if not found)
"Business" (default fallback)
```

### **Offline Support:**
- Business name is cached with features
- Available for 24 hours without internet
- Auto-refreshes on login

---

## ✅ Testing

### **Test for New Businesses:**
1. Create a new business signup (e.g., "TestBusiness Ltd")
2. Super Admin approves it
3. Log in with that business account
4. Check sidebar - should show "TestBusiness Ltd"

### **Test for Existing Businesses:**
1. Log in as an existing business
2. May show "Business" (no metadata yet)
3. Log out and log back in
4. Should now show the actual business name

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Edge Function Deployed**
```bash
Deployed Functions on project cddoboboxeangripcqrn: business-signup-requests
```

✅ **Frontend Updated**
- Sidebar.tsx ✅
- authService.ts ✅

✅ **No Breaking Changes**
- Backwards compatible with existing users
- Fallback to "Business" if name not found

## 📝 Notes

1. **Existing Users**: Will see "Business" until they log out/in again or their metadata is manually updated
2. **Cashiers**: Already see their shop name (no change needed)
3. **Super Admin**: Still sees "Super Admin Panel" (no business name needed)
4. **Customization**: Each business sees their own name, making the system feel personalized

## 🎉 Result

Every business that signs up will now see their own company name at the top of the dashboard, making the system feel like it's truly theirs! 🏢✨
